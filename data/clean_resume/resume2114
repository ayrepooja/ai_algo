rationale date target geely automobile hk buying price hk yield catalyst the current market holds pessimistic opinion auto industry facing overcapacity i found automobile demand lower middle class growing strongly via field work 3rd 6th tier cities china despite weak sedan market geely still make gains selling popular sedan brands and annual indicating geely successful importing r d design technology volvo hence i estimate company enter stage rapid development starts produce brand new suvs results beyond expectation important signal industry analysis the competition pattern china's auto market become centralized over past years auto industry experienced transition multi brand competition oligarch competition showing competition pattern auto industry comes centralized market previous diversified one for current auto market china exists lots brands varying quality as excess capacity china s auto industry continues deteriorate number chinese brands low quality probably eliminated ultimately winners obtain greater market shares the cost channel decisive factors winners come private enterprises occupying auto market 3rd 6th tier cities china from industry mobile sporting goods beverages household appliances consumer products leading companies provide best quality products moderate quality ones lower price attracting masses lower middle class the reason high quality products difficult obtain large market share large population china living 3rd 6th tier cities lower middle class majority hence first class brands came sell well 1st 2nd tier cities china medium low end brands captured greater market share 3rd 6th tier cities due high price lack channel advantage first class brands difficult penetrate 3rd 6th tier cities but certain chinese low end brands successful provide products higher qualities lower price 3rd 6th tier cities anta lenovo oppo chinese brands good examples chinese branded autos stronger growth potential foreign joint venture brands in current auto market prices joint ventures foreign passenger vehicles mainly rmb far beyond level mass consumption 3rd 6th tier cities hence brands hard popular among chinese small medium sized cities chinese branded passenger vehicles sell well sales price rmb due good cost performance channel advantages chinese branded autos broad market prospects as joint venture foreign brands typically reluctant initiate price war competing chinese brands further lack channel advantages marketing insight small medium sized cities often slow making decisions due complicated organizations management modes therefore joint venture foreign passenger vehicles difficult penetrate 3rd 6th cities china but chinese branded companies promote product qualities affordable prices become auto market leaders massive competitive advantages company analysis by successful integration volvo geely gained sustainable competitive advantage since acquiring volvo geely strongly supported r d design volvo within many years group integration and new product gc9 became biggest seller chinese brand b class sedan market the huge advantages geely follows quality geely s core technologies including engine safety technology new products mainly volvo therefore quality better many domestic brands design geely s new brands charge volvo chief designer as appearance factor consumers concerned purchasing cars improved appearance new cars promote sales significantly cost geely shares common purchasing channel manufacturing platform volvo also get free technical support volvo therefore production mode make cost lower chinese branded passenger vehicles due patent fee costing selling price high import tax joint venture foreign passenger vehicles typically bear higher cost strong competitiveness help geely gain greater market shares even falling market although car market highly competitive geely still achieved growth revenue plus growth profit far higher peers the new models keep selling well indicating geely s strategy marketing successful switch multi brand strategy boutique strategy market positioning by offering better quality services company able take market shares competitors even falling market geely's sedan sales better domestic cars since source company information internet via entering suv market sales price rmb geely able meet great potential demands offering high quality low priced cars in recent years china's suv car market maintained rapid development still difficult buy cars 100k rmb residents 3rd 6th cities therefore large number chinese brands great wall began sell new suv prices around 90k rmb meeting potential demand as bestseller gc9 shows geely s success introducing technology design volvo geely decides launch suvs balancing product strategy sedan suv enhancing competitiveness and brand new suv boyue starts around 100k rmb close competitor great wall haval h6 cost efficient hence i predict geely boyue s sales may day orders next months far stronger expected geely gc9 ranked top china s b class car sales 1st among chinese brands first time thousands source internet in market unit price rmb geely still beat domestic jv foreign brands whether 100k 130k rmb market hot market currently 10k 13k rmbmarket popular next years due china s consumption upgrade geely owns unbeatable competitive advantages and reasons follows firstly geely's technical advantages stemmed successful acquisition high end brand volvo competitors like changan great wall mainly rely r d typically takes much longer time get improved products further even competition goes

years going negotiation acquisition integration introduction new cars further according statistics cross border acquisitions ended failure refer acquisition ssangyong motors saic motor alcatel tcl nokia microsoft ericsson sony hence chinese auto brands beat geely next years thirdly foreign joint venture cars mainly positioned high and mid end product markets consumers 3rd 6th cities cannot afford expansive cars in addition big companies organizational structures typically complex difficult make quick responses market hard concentrate penetrating middle lower income cities geely's strategy successful sustainable become another anta auto industry as anta leading sports goods enterprise china by producing cars higher quality lower price combined effective marketing plus management geely likely become leader 3rd 6th tier cities greatest market china the development path geely much like anta sports hk one leading sports goods enterprise china instead competing nike
